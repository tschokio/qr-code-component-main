## My process

### Built with

- Non-semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Showed me that I still do not fully understand flexbox and its behaviour, took me many trial and error attemps to finally get the, hopefully, right layout.

The code feels more complex as need be, will redo it right after uploading v1.



### Continued development

As noted aboce, will reinforce my knowledge about flexbox by redoing the whole challenge, as I'm not satisfied with the code, the result looks fine to me.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - great overview of all the options flexbox offers.
